00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:05,816
Hey, Zoe.

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,819
Oh, hey.

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:09,945
What ya doing?

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,821
Um, I’m just about to meet . . .

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,155
. . . Sophia.

6
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:15,365
Why do you hang out with her?

7
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:21,370
Does it bother you
that others think you’re different?

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,080
What do you mean?

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,789
I don’t know.

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,832
I-I gotta go.

11
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,211
You should hang out with us

12
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,504
—not that loser.

13
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,839
People aren’t always nice

14
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,882
to others they think are different.

15
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:39,300
Hey, Zoe,

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,843
aren’t you coming?
